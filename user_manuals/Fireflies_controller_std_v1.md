## Exploring advanced controls
#### What can be adjusted in the advanced controls
By adjusting the switches inside the black controller you can change the following
* Make the controller work with different WS2812B RGB LED string if the color of the fireflies is the wrong color when you connect the different string
* Tell be control box if there are 50, 100, 150 , or 200 LEDs in the string.  Useful if you change to a different LED string
* Chose a different color than the warm white.  Choices are a couple of bluer white choices, a mode where the colors cycle through the rainbow, blue, green, red, and purple.
#### Locating the 8 position DIP switch
* To adjust the advanced settings you will need to open the box and adjust the setting of 8 position DIP switch. This is safe because the box only recieves 5V power like a cell phone does.
* To access the switches unscrew all four screws holding he lid of the box to lower part of the box.  Open the box noting the location of the white gasket that helps keep water and dust out of the box.
* Locate the red or black 8 postion DIP switch
#### The three areas of the DIP switch
* There are 8 switches on the DIP switch
  * Switches 6, 7, and 8 control the color order in case you need to connect a differnt LED string that does not produce the same firefly color.  For example if the firefly colore appears red instead of the yellow you see in the string shipped with the controller.
  * Switch
