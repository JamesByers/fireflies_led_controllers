# User information for your Fireflies Standard LED Controller v1 - User manual

Congratulations on your new Byers Built Fireflies LED Controller and light string!  You can have simulated fireflies indoors or out whenever you want.

This page describe set up and use of your new Fireflies and controller.

### Familiarize yourself with the external controls
#### The on/off push button switch
When the button is pushed in the fireflies will start to turn on.  When the button is pushed again so the button is out the device turns off.
#### The two position toggle switch
Selecting between Firefly color yellow or white
#### The rotary knob
Rotating the knob increases or decreased the brightness of the next fireflies that light up.
### Connecting it together and plugging it in
There are four components.  The power adapter, the black control box, the optional extender between the LED light string itself.
## Exploring advanced controls
#### What can be adjusted in the advanced controls
By adjusting the switches inside the black controller you can change the following
* Make the controller work with different WS2812B RGB LED string if the color of the fireflies is the wrong color when you connect the different string
* Tell be control box if there are 50, 100, 150 , or 200 LEDs in the string.  Useful if you change to a different LED string
* Chose a different color than the warm white.  Choices are a couple of bluer white choices, a mode where the colors cycle through the rainbow, blue, green, red, and purple.
#### Locating the 8 position DIP switch
* To adjust the advanced settings you will need to open the box and adjust the setting of 8 position DIP switch. This is safe because the box only recieves 5V power like a cell phone does.
* To access the switches unscrew all four screws holding he lid of the box to lower part of the box.  Open the box noting the location of the white gasket that helps keep water and dust out of the box.
* Locate the red or black 8 postion DIP switch
#### The three areas of the DIP switch
* There are 8 switches on the DIP switch
  * Switches 6, 7, and 8 set the color order in case you need to connect a differnt LED string that does not produce the same firefly color.  For example if the firefly colore appears red instead of the yellow you see in the string shipped with the controller.  
  * Switches 4 and 5 set whether the LED string has 50, 100, 150, or 200 lights in it
  * Switches 1, 2, and 3 change the alternate color from the warm white to another color.  This color is for when the external toggle switch is switched from fireflies to the alternate color.  This color is set to warm white originally.
