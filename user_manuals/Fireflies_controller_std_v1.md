## Fireflies Standard LED Controller v1  

Congratulations on your new Byers-Built Fireflies LED Controller and light string!
<br>

This controller and light string are designed to be used indoor or out. 
I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed designing and building it for you.

This page describes the set up and use of your new Fireflies.

#### Connect and test the light strip
1. Connect the USB-C cord from the power adapter into the USB-C port on the control box
2. Fireflies should start lighting up and fading out.  If they do not locate the push button on/off switch on the side of the control box wthat has the USB-port, If the button is not pushed in. push it in and the fireflies should start to light up.
3. If the fireflies do not start up check that the power adapter is properly plugged in to a wall socket and that the USB-C cable is properly plugged in.
### Familiarize yourself with the external controls
* Try out the On/Off button
  * Next to the USB-C port, locate the push button on/off switch
  * Push the button in and the fireflies will start to turn on.  When the button is pushed again and the button is out the device turns off.
    * Note your Fireflies can by used with a timer by plugging the power adapter into a timer and making sure the control box's On/Off push button switch is set to the On (pushed in) position.
* Try out the two position toggle switch
  * Locate the toggle switch on the opposite end of the control box
  * Flip the toggle switch to change between Firefly color yellow or white
* Try out the rotary knob
  * Locate the rotating knob.  Turning the knob increases or decreased the brightness of the next fireflies that light up.
* Now enjoy your fireflies!  

#### The additional advanced settings inside the box
By adjusting the switches inside the control box you can change the following:
* Chose a different color than the warm white when the toggle switch is switched.  Choices are a couple of bluer white choices, a mode where the colors cycle through the rainbow, or blue, green, red, or purple.
* Change settings to match another LED string
 * This controller is designed to match most, if not all WS2812B type RGB LED type strings or light strips.  To do so requires setting a few switches inside the control box.
  * For example with a different string if the color of the fireflies is the wrong color (not yellow) then you set the controller for a color order that match the different string
  * And you can set control box to match a different string with 50, 100, 150 , or 200 LEDs in the string.  Useful if you change to a different LED string
#### To change settings open the control box and locate the 8 position DIP switch
1. To adjust the advanced settings you will need to open the box and adjust the setting of 8 position DIP switch. This is safe because the box only recieves 5V power from the power adapter, just like a cell phone does.
2. To access the 8 position DIP switch
  1. Unplug the USC-C cord from the control box
  2. Unscrew all four screws holding he lid to the box to lower part of the box.  Open the box noting the location of the white gasket that helps keep water and dust out of the box.
  3. Locate the red or black 8 position DIP switch
#### The three areas of the DIP switch
* There are 8 individually numbered switches on the DIP switch
  * Switches 6, 7, and 8 set the color order in case you need to connect a differnt LED string that does not produce the same firefly color.  For example if the firefly colore appears red instead of the yellow you see in the string shipped with the controller.  
  * Switches 4 and 5 set whether the LED string has 50, 100, 150, or 200 lights in it
  * Switches 1, 2, and 3 change the alternate color from the warm white to another color.  This color is for when the external toggle switch is switched from fireflies to the alternate color.  This color is set to warm white originally.
 
### When and how to change the switches inside the control box.
Note: Do not change switches 4 thru 8 unless you are attaching a LED string different from the one

* Changing the alternative color from the toggle switch
