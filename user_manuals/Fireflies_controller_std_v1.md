## Fireflies LED Controller v2  - With 8 position 

Congratulations on your new Byers Built Fireflies LED Controller and light string!
<br>
I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed designing and building it for you. <br> <br>
This guide describes the set up and use of your new Fireflies.

### Connect and test the light string
1. Plug the USB-C charger into a 120V wall outlet.
2. Connect the USB-C cord from the power adapter into the USB-C port on the control box
3. In a few seconds the Fireflies should start lighting up and fading out.  If they do not light up, locate the on/off push button switch on the end of the control box. If the button is not pushed in, push it in and the fireflies should start to light up.
4. If the fireflies do not start up check that the power adapter is properly plugged in to a wall socket and that the USB-C cable is properly plugged in.
### Familiarize yourself with the external controls
* Try out the On/Off button
  * Next to the USB-C port on the end of the controller box, locate the push button on/off switch.
  * Push the button in and the fireflies will start to turn on.  When the button is pushed again and the button is out the controller turns off.
    * Note your Fireflies can by used with a timer by plugging the power adapter into a timer and making sure the control box's On/Off push button switch is set to the On (pushed in) position.
* Try out the two position toggle switch
  * Locate the toggle switch on the opposite end of the control box
  * Flip the toggle switch to change between a Firefly color of yellow or white
* Try out the rotary knob
  * Locate the rotating knob.  Turning the knob increases or decreased the brightness of the next fireflies that light up.
  * Adjust the brightness‚Å∑ level to your liking
* Spread out the LED string and enjoy your fireflies!
### Tips
* While the controller is designed and built to be water resistant, the socket where the USB-C cord plugs into the controller is exposed.  If used outside, it is assumed that the controller box is under an overhang near the wall socket and therefore out of direct rainfall.  If not, it is best to put something over the controller (board, etc.) or use some Gorilla Tape or other waterproof tape to protect the USB-C cable connection from rainfall.
* For the most realistic firefies set the switch to yellow and turn the brightness level all the way down.
* When the fireflies are set to white instead of yellow, and you want them dim, consider setting them not all the way dim. If the white is fully dimmed there is a red hue right before the firefly goes out. This can be avoided by not fully dimming the warm white.
* The QR code on the bottom of the controller box, and the one inside the box, point to this Quick Start Guide.

### Advanced settings

</p>

By adjusting switches inside the control box you can change the following:
* Chose a different color than the warm white when the toggle switch is switched.  Choices are a couple of bluer white choices, a mode where the colors cycle through the rainbow, blue, green, red, or purple.
* Change settings to match a different LED string
  * This controller is designed to match most, if not all, WS2812B type RGB LED type strings or light strips.  To do so may require setting a few switches inside the control box.
    * Set the color order.  You would do this if you attached a different LED string and the colors are incorrect. 
    * Set to match a different number of LEDs in the string.  And you can set string lengths for 50, 100, 150 , or 200 LEDs in the string.
      * You can also use this to limit the number of LEDs lit in a longer string.  For example, if you have a 100 LED string or longer you can set it to 50.  Only the first 50 LEDs will be lit.  This can be useful if you want to cover a smaller area than you would with the full longer string.

To change any of these advanced settings please see the [Advanced Features Guide](./v1_advanced_features.md).
