## Fireflies LED Controller v2  - With 8 position effect rotary switch!

Congratulations on your new Byers Built Fireflies LED Controller and light string!
<br>
I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed designing and building it for you. <br> <br>
This guide describes the set up and use of your new Fireflies.

This page is the Quick Start Guide for the v2 Firefly LED controllers.

Note: V2 contollers provide an 8 position rotary switch rather than the two position toggel switch the v1 controllers provide.

### Connect and test the light string
1. Plug the USB-C charger into a 120V wall outlet.
2. Connect the USB-C cord from the power adapter into the USB-C port on the control box
3. In a few seconds the Fireflies should start lighting up and fading out.  If they do not light up, locate the on/off push button switch on the end of the control box. If the button is not pushed in, push it in and the fireflies should start to light up.
4. If the fireflies do not start up check that the power adapter is properly plugged in to a wall socket and that the USB-C cable is properly plugged in.
### Familiarize yourself with the external controls
* Try out the On/Off button
  * Next to the USB-C port on the end of the controller box, locate the push button on/off switch.
  * Push the button in and in a few seconds the fireflies will start to turn on.  When the button is pushed again and the button is out the controller turns off.
    * Note your Fireflies can by used with a timer by plugging the power adapter into a timer and making sure the control box's On/Off push button switch is set to the On (pushed in) position.
* Try out the eight position rotary switch
  * Locate the eight position rotary switch on the opposite end of the control box.  This is the knob on the right.
  * Rotate the eight position rotary switch change between these effects
    * Rotated all the way to the left - Yellow fireflies color
    * Warm white fireflies
    * Orange with occasional purple fireflies
       Blue with a occasional green firefiles
    * User selects hue for fireflies with left knob
       * The Left Knob changes from a dimmer to selecting a hue for fireflies.
       * The previous dimmer selection is used.
    * Transitions fireflies through all hues
    * *All LEDs on*. User selects hue with the left knob for all LEDs on at once.
       * The left Knob changes from a dimmer to selecting a hue for fireflies.
       * The previous dimmer selection is used.
    * *All LEDS on*. Transitions through all hues.
* Try out the rotary dimmer/hue knob on the left 
  * Locate the rotating knob to the left of the rotary switch knob.
   * When a effect is a fireflies type, turning the knob increases or decreased the brightness of the next fireflies that light up.  Set the brighness to your liking.  It is recommended that for the most realistic yellow fireflies you rotate the brightness knob all the way to the left to be the dimmest.  But for other settings this is often to low and caused odd color artifacts as LEDS go all the way to off.  For any setting other than yellow fireflies I recommend that the brightness be set to your preference betweena bit brighter than minimal all the way up to full brightness.
   * Note that when an effect where the user selects the hue, the left rotary knb no longer adjusts the amount of brightness but instead adjusts the hue of the LEDs.  In these cases the controller used the brightness setting that was last set when the last fireflies effect was chosen.
    * For example let's say you select effect 5:   "User selects hue for fireflies with left knob:
     * The left knob knob will let you choose your hue.  Be aware that when you rotate the knob the hue change can be large.  For fine adjustments of hue, turn the knob only slightly and wait for the LEDs to populate so you can see the hue change.  Then adjust more as needed.
     * When the effect is one where you select the hue, the controller will use the brightness set when an earlier effect provided it's own hue.
     *   What do I do if I have chosen an hue in effect 5 or 7 above and want to change the brightness?  Simple rotate the selector back to an effect where you do not choose the hue and ajust the brightness there.  Then simply rotate the selector switch on the right back to effect where you choose the hue and the amount of brightness will be remembered and the left knb will again select hue.
* Spread out the LED string and enjoy your fireflies!
### Tips
* While the controller is designed and built to be water resistant, the socket where the USB-C cord plugs into the controller is exposed.  If used outside, it is assumed that the controller box is under an overhang near the wall socket and therefore out of direct rainfall.  If not, it is best to put something over the controller (board, etc.) or use some Gorilla Tape or other waterproof tape to protect the USB-C cable connection from rainfall.
* For the most realistic firefies set the switch to yellow and turn the brightness level all the way down.
* When the fireflies are set to white instead of yellow, and you want them dim, consider setting them not all the way dim. If the white is fully dimmed there is a red hue right before the firefly goes out. This can be avoided by not fully dimming the warm white.
* The QR code on the bottom of the controller box, and the one inside the box, point to this Quick Start Guide.

### Advanced settings

</p>

By adjusting switches inside the control box you can change the following:
* Chose a different color than the warm white when the toggle switch is switched.  Choices are a couple of bluer white choices, a mode where the colors cycle through the rainbow, blue, green, red, or purple.
* Change settings to match a different LED string
  * This controller is designed to match most, if not all, WS2812B type RGB LED type strings or light strips.  To do so may require setting a few switches inside the control box.
    * Set the color order.  You would do this if you attached a different LED string and the colors are incorrect. 
    * Set to match a different number of LEDs in the string.  And you can set string lengths for 50, 100, 150 , or 200 LEDs in the string.
      * You can also use this to limit the number of LEDs lit in a longer string.  For example, if you have a 100 LED string or longer you can set it to 50.  Only the first 50 LEDs will be lit.  This can be useful if you want to cover a smaller area than you would with the full longer string.

To change any of these advanced settings please see the [Advanced Features Guide](./v1_advanced_features.md).
