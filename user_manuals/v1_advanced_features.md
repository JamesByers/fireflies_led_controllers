#### To change settings open the control box and locate the 8 position DIP switch
1. To adjust the advanced settings you will need to open the box and adjust the setting of 8 position DIP switch. This is safe because the box only recieves 5V power from the power adapter, just like a cell phone does.
2. To access the 8 position DIP switch
  1. Unplug the USC-C cord from the control box
  2. Unscrew all four screws holding he lid to the box to lower part of the box.  Open the box noting the location of the white gasket that helps keep water and dust out of the box.
  3. Locate the red or black 8 position DIP switch
#### The three areas of the DIP switch
* There are 8 individually numbered switches on the DIP switch
  * Switches 6, 7, and 8 set the color order in case you need to connect a differnt LED string that does not produce the same firefly color.  For example if the firefly colore appears red instead of the yellow you see in the string shipped with the controller.  
  * Switches 4 and 5 set whether the LED string has 50, 100, 150, or 200 lights in it
  * Switches 1, 2, and 3 change the alternate color from the warm white to another color.  This color is for when the external toggle switch is switched from fireflies to the alternate color.  This color is set to warm white originally.
 
### When and how to change the switches inside the control box.
